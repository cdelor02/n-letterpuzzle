# n-letterpuzzle

Inspired by the 8-letter word puzzle found on [this](https://www.riddles.com/best-riddles) site, I was wondering what the best way would be to compute all the 8-letter words that satisfy the riddle, which is: 

_What 8 letter word can have a letter taken away and it still makes a word. Take another letter away and it still makes a word. Keep on doing that until you have one letter left. What is the word?_
